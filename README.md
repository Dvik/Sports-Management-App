# Sports-Management-App

This android app was made as a part of Software Engineering Course. There are three important modules: Events, Approval, Inventory and Notifications. The unique thing about this app is that one can add events just by tapping on the map and also view all the events on the Map itself. The app also follows material design principles and makes use of latest widgets. Software design principles(like requirements gathering, agile methologies) were religiously followed while making the app. Project Management was done using Pivotal Tracker. The entire project can be found on the URL listed above.
